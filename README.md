#Are Those Clouds?!

## Synopsis
Are Those Clouds?! is a simple web application designed to give you the local weather. The background switches based on the weater and you can toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It uses the Open Weather API. 

## Motivation
I'm making Are Those Clouds?! to practice with native JS in the browser and API's.
